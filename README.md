# Teaching Accessibility in AI Courses
We created teaching materials that can be used to cover accessibility topics in AI courses.
1. Short guest lecture ([slides](Accessibility_and_AI.pptx))
2. Short assignment ([Assignemnt1: Text classification](a1.ipynb))
3. Course project ([Final project](Final_Project.ipynb))
