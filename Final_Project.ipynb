        "Your first task is to pick a project topic. Pick an NLP application that you are passionate about or something you find interesting. One important aspect of designing your project is to identify one or several well-defined dataset that you can use for your project. If that data needs considerable pre-processing to suit your task, or if you intend to collect the needed data yourself, keep in mind that this is only one part of the expected project work, but can often take considerable time. We still expect a solid implementation and discussion of results, so pace your project accordingly. \n",

        "Many of the items below represent a topic rather than a specific project. Thus, many projects or variations of a single project are possible for each topic. The general idea is that the project will allow you to get a hands-on experience and allow you to learn/investigate a topic in far more detail than what would be possible from class discussions alone. Please note that the criteria for success in the project is not limited to an effective system (accurate, efficient etc.). For the purposes of this course, I care more about why you considered the investigated problem to be important, how you addressed the main issues/challenges, what you learnt etc. More detail on the project assessment can be found in the latter part of this document.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final project can be a group project. Indeed, by working as a group, you can attempt something larger and more interesting. However, the amount of work should be appropriately scaled to the size of the group, and you should include a brief statement on the responsibilities of different members of the team. Team members will normally get the same grade, but I reserve the right to differentiate in egregious cases. In general we would like group size of 2; if you are considering a bigger group, you need to talk to me. Solo projects are, of course, allowed.\n",
